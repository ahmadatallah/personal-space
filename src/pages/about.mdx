# About

<Img fixed={props.data.file.childImageSharp.fixed} />

I&apos;m Ahmad Atallah. An egyptian software engineer who&apos;s
doing mostly frontend stuff. Also, I&apos;m interested in functional
programming, and design. I do minimal things that&apos;s why
terseness is something I prefer. I like taking visual photos. Photos
that I pass by in my daily life; every single day. Noam Chomsky once
said: &quot;When you walk around, you&apos;re talking to yourself.
You can&apos;t stop. I mean, it takes a real act of will not to talk
to yourself, and what you&apos;re doing is thinking&quot;, and I
find this is about the actual state of my mind all the time.
