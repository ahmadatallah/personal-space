I'm Ahmad Atallah. An Egyptian software engineer who's doing mostly frontend stuff. Also, interested in functional programming, and generative art. I like taking visual photos. Photos that I pass by in my daily life; every single day. Noam Chomsky once said: "When you walk around, you're talking to yourself. You can't stop. I mean, it takes a real act of will not talk to yourself, and what you're doing is thinking", and I find this is about the actual state of my mind all the time.

Not to forget, I'm table tennis player &#x1F3D3;
