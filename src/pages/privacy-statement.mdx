This privacy statement applies to the personal website of Ahmad Atallah at atallahsan.cc.

## What I Don't Collect

I've built this website with privacy in mind. I don't use:

- Analytics or tracking (no Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.)
- Cookies for tracking your behavior
- User accounts or registration systems
- Any personal data collection forms

## What May Be Collected

**Server Logs**: Like most websites, the web server automatically logs basic technical information (IP addresses, browser types, page requests) for security and maintenance purposes. This data isn't linked to your identity or shared with anyone.

**Email Contact**: If you email me, I keep our correspondence to provide helpful responses. Your email address is only used to reply to you.

**Accessibility Settings**: The accessibility widget stores your preferences locally in your browser - nothing is sent to my servers.

## Your Rights

You can request access to, correction of, or deletion of any personal information. Contact me at [hi@atallahsan.cc](mailto:hi@atallahsan.cc) with any privacy concerns.

- **Access**: Request information about any data that might be collected
- **Rectification**: Request correction of any inaccurate information
- **Erasure**: Request deletion of any personal information
- **Portability**: Request a copy of any personal data in a machine-readable format
- **Objection**: Object to processing of your personal information

This site links to external websites that have their own privacy policies. I'm not responsible for their practices.
