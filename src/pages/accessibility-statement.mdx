# Accessibility Statement

This accessibility statement applies to the personal website of Ahmad Atallah at atallahsan.cc.

## My Commitment

I'm committed to ensuring that this website is accessible to people with disabilities. I believe that everyone should be able to access and enjoy my content, regardless of their abilities or the technology they use.

## Accessibility Features

I have implemented the following accessibility features:

### Navigation & Structure

- **Semantic HTML**: I use proper HTML structure with headings, lists, and landmarks
- **Skip navigation**: Screen reader users can skip to main content
- **Consistent navigation**: Navigation elements are consistently placed and labeled
- **Clear page titles**: Each page has a descriptive title that explains its purpose

### Visual Design

- **Color contrast**: I maintain sufficient color contrast ratios for text readability
- **Scalable text**: Text can be resized up to 150% without loss of functionality
- **Focus indicators**: Interactive elements have clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- **Color independence**: Information is not conveyed through color alone

### Interactive Elements

- **Keyboard navigation**: All interactive elements can be accessed using only a keyboard
- **Alt text**: All images have descriptive alternative text
- **Form labels**: All form inputs have clear, descriptive labels
- **Link descriptions**: Links have descriptive text that explains their purpose

### Attention & Focus Support

- **ADHD-friendly features**: Mouse-following focus spotlight to reduce visual distractions
- **Customizable reading experience**: Adjustable text size and contrast settings
- **Distraction reduction**: Ability to dim non-essential content while reading
- **Epilepsy-safe mode**: Animations are deactivated and dangerous color combinations reduced to prevent seizure triggers

### Accessibility Tools

I provide an accessibility widget that includes:

- **Text size adjustment**: Increase or decrease text size from 80% to 150%
- **High contrast mode**: Enhanced contrast for better visibility
- **ADHD Focus Mode**: Creates a reading spotlight that follows your mouse cursor, dimming surrounding content to reduce visual distractions and help maintain focus on specific text areas
- **Epilepsy-safe mode**: Deactivates animations and reduces dangerous color combinations to prevent seizure triggers
- **Easy access**: Floating button always available on every page

## Standards Compliance

This website aims to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities.

## Technology Used

This website is built using:

- **Gatsby.js**: A modern web framework that supports accessibility best practices
- **React**: Component-based architecture that enables semantic HTML
- **Theme UI**: Consistent design system with accessibility considerations

## Known Issues

I am continuously working to improve accessibility. Currently known issues include:

- Some third-party embedded content may not be fully accessible
- Motion sensitivity concerns are addressed through our epilepsy-safe mode which can disable animations
