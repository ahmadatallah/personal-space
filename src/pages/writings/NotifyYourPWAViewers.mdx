# Notify A Progressive Web App (PWA) Updates

Offline/Cache-first is one of the main key features in any Progressive Web Apps, but according to 
[create-react-app docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/):
`"the offline/cache-first behavior is opt-in only. By default, the build process will generate a service worker file, 
but it will not be registered, so it will not take control of your production web app."`
, this will get you in a very disturbing state when your app already built, without registering service worker, and deployed to some bunch of
people who are using it regulary!. Disturbing because users will not notice your updates unless they explicitly hard reload the browser or
even close all tabs. That's why I think that registering service worker should be a proactive decision because it will affect the user who
almost aren't familiar with offline-first apps. So, if you take a decision to go on with registering service worker, it will be better to
handle this from the first release of your app then users will get update message everytime your app updated.
In this article I will discuss how to register service worker correctly in your
create-react-app PWA and notify the user with any updates goes live.

The solution requires a basic knowledge about service worker, `react`, `redux` and `react-redux` the official react bindings for redux.

## Create React App Insights
I will reference create react app documentation in this section just to get you familiar with 
offline first apps.

- [Faster and reliable](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/#why-opt-in):

    Offline-first Progressive Web Apps are more faster and reliable than traditional apps because it actually caches all your static assets that
    can be served regardless of your network connectivty. Also, using `manifest.json` file located in
    your project public directory used to add a mobile app version of the app without any need to install it from the store.
    Defining your `icon`, `name`, and `start_url` of your project are the main configurations for a mobile-app like view.

- [Require HTTPS](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/#offline-first-considerations):

    Service workers require HTTPS and don't apply to `localhost`, not recommended in development environment, and it
    can only be applied in production environment. So, better to test it by serving the `build` directory using 
    [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) npm package
    ```sh
        npm install -g serve
    ```
- [No Interception with CORS](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/#offline-first-considerations):

    The generated service worker doesn't intercept any cross-origin resources like HTTP API requests.
