# Create React App: Run-time vs Build-time Environment Variables

This post will show you how I migrate create-react-app custom environement variables from build-time to be configurable at run-time.
According to create-react-app [docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables) we can not embed environement variables during runtime.
so defining them with the prefix `REACT_APP_` will expose them only in build-time where you can access them by `process.env.REACT_APP_KEY`

Note: I will use these aliases throughout the rest of article:

- **env vars** instead of environment variables
- **env/s** instead of enviroment/s

## Initializing Envirnoment Variables in Build Time

To define env vars in build-time, just put your own env vars keys into `.env` file located in your home path, and prefixed by `REACT_APP_`.
The env vars in this file will be exposed into your JS code in development enviroment only.
There are more configurable ways to define env vars in test, production envs and even override all the three envs
locally on your machine as descriped in create-react-app [docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables) as the following:

- test env > add the env vars in `.env.test`
- prodcution env > add the env vars in `.env.production`
- locally-test-override env > add env vars in `.env.local.test`
- locally-production-override > add env vars in `.env.local.production`
- locally-development-override > add env vars in `.env.local.development`

There is something to be considered; `.env` files have precedence rules based on which npm/yarn command you will run as the following:

- `yarn/npm start`: `.env.development.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.local`, `.env`
- `yarn/npm build`: `.env.production.local`, `.env.prodcution`, `.env.local`, `.env`
- `yarn/npm test`: `.env.test.local`, `.env.test`, `.env`

when the precedence is from the left to the right.

Note: `.env.local` is missing from `yarn/npm test` and don't know why! but it is mentioned in create-react-app docs!

A final example will be a `.env` file with env vars keys and values like this:

```js
REACT_APP_KEY = some - value;
```

## Migrate to Run Time Environment Variables

This is a hack solution because the definition of env vars in browsers does not even exist. It is something like a fake abstraction as mentioned [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-implement-runtime-environment-variables-with-create-react-app-docker-and-nginx-7f9d42a91d70/).
We will keep our `.env` file only with the default develepment env vars as it is our main concern now!

### How this will be done?

I will extract the env vars in `.env` file into a new javascript config file using a simple bash script as below imported from [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-implement-runtime-environment-variables-with-create-react-app-docker-and-nginx-7f9d42a91d70/)

```bash

#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Recreate config file

rm -rf ./env-config.js
touch ./env-config.js

# Add assignment

echo "window._env_ = {" >> ./env-config.js

# Read each line in .env file

# Each line represents key=value pairs

while read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]];
do

  # Split env variables by character `=`

  if printf '%s\n' "$line" | grep -q -e '='; then

       varname=$(printf '%s\n' "$line" | sed -e 's/=.*//')

       varvalue=$(printf '%s\n' "$line" | sed -e 's/^[^=]*=//')

  fi

  # Read value of current variable if exists as Environment variable

  value=$(printf '%s\n' "${!varname}")

  # Otherwise use value from .env file

  [[ -z $value ]] && value=${varvalue}

  # Append configuration property to JS file

  echo "  $varname: \"$value\"," >> ./env-config.js
done < .env

echo "}" >> ./env-config.js
```

<br></br>

This will create `env-config.js` file that you will need to embed it like below:

```html
<script src="%PUBLIC_URL%/env-config.js"></script>
```

<br></br>

into your `public/index.html`. Finally this is how the file will look like:

```js
window.__env__ = {
  REACT_APP_KEY: value
};
```

### Putting All Together

To get all of these running in development, you will need to:

• update `yarn/npm start` command to

```bash
./env.sh && ./env.sh && cp env-config.js ./public/ && react-scripts start
```

• update all

```js
process.env.REACT_APP_KEY;
```
to
```js
window.__env__.REACT_APP_KEY;
```

#### Setup Tests Environment Variables

Doing all of the above will not guarantee running your test suites correctly, actually, you will see an error
that can't read property `REACT_APP_KEY` of undefined. This is because `__env__`
is not exposed in test environment which by the way is a build-time process. There is a hack solution
for this problem which reusing `.env` file to assign all the values from it to `__env__`
into your `setupTests.js` like below:

```js
window.__env__ = {
  REACT_APP_KEY: process.env.REACT_APP_KEY
};
```
