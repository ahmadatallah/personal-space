# Navigate then Change The Theme; An Experiment to useLayoutEffect React Hook

In a brief, useLayoutEffect React hook can prevent flash of unstyled content (FOUC) by
blocking the page till the new styles applied. Blocking the content by a synchronous process
happens after all DOM mutations. This synchronous process includes reading the layout
from the DOM, rerendering, and, as React [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#uselayouteffect) says,
flushing the scheduled updated before the browser has a chance to paint.

<Collage
  photos={[useEffectResults[0]]}
  totalPages={0}
  initialLength={8}
  disallowScrollLoad={true}
/>

## Theme configuration

Before digging into the example that visualize this process in action,
we need to define a set of color modes that will change respectivly on every navigation.
I will use [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/) as a ui library for creating user interfaces
based on a global theme configuration. It allows you to easily reference theme values
throughout the entire application.

For creating color modes, there is a hook from theme-ui called [`useColorMode`](https://theme-ui.com/guides/color-mode-toggles) that
toggle or even cycle through a set of color modes defined in the theme file.

For the example we will use two color modes light and dark:

```js
/* theme.js */
{
...
  colors: {
    modes: {
      light: {
        text: '#000',
        background: '#fff',
        primary: 'hsl(120, 100%, 40%)',
        secondary: '#000',
        accent: 'hsl(120, 100%, 90%)',
        muted: 'hsl(120, 20%, 7%)',
        gray: 'hsl(0, 0%, 75%)',
        code: 'hsla(360, 100%, 100%, 0.5)',
      },
      dark: {
        text: '#fff',
        background: 'hsl(180, 5%, 15%)',
        primary: 'hsl(180, 100%, 57%)',
        secondary: 'hsl(50, 100%, 57%)',
        accent: 'hsl(310, 100%, 57%)',
        muted: 'hsl(180, 5%, 5%)',
        gray: 'hsl(180, 0%, 70%)',
      },
      ...
      // you can define more modes here
    },
  }
...
}
```

we will cycle through the modes by a function as below:

```js
export default function useColorModes({ ...props }) {
  const [colorMode, setColorMode] = useColorMode();
  const modes = ['light', 'dark'];

  const applyMode = currentMode => {
    const i = modes.indexOf(currentMode);
    const n = (i + 1) % modes.length;
    const nextMode = modes[n];
    setColorMode(nextMode);
  };

  // returns current color mode and applier function for the next mode
  return { colorMode, applyMode };
}
```

## useLayoutEffect vs useEffect

Now, we will take these theme configurations in action.
we will see the difference between the `useLayoutEffect` and `useEffect` when trying to toggle between these modes.

According to React docs, useLayoutEffect is the same as useEffect except it synchronously fires after all DOM mutations
this will block the content in our case, while toggling between modes and flush the updates before even the browser paint any content on the page.

`useLayoutEffect` and `useEffect` takes a function as a first argument that runs and applies the side effect after the render is committed.
As a second argument it takes an array of dependencies that on changing them the effectful function runs.
Be cautious when using dependencies because it might lead to endless number of renderings.

Note: the function from the first argument returns undefined if you don't return anything from it which may cause memory leaks.
Better to clean up things by explicitly returning a cleanup function for your effect.
You can read React [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect) for detailed information.

## Applying color modes with useLayoutEffect

Finally, we will apply both `useLayoutEffect` and `useEffect` according to the code snippet below:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider, ColorMode } from 'theme-ui';
import React, { useLayoutEffect, useEffect } from 'React';
import useColorModes from './userColorModes';

function App() {
  const { colorMode, applyMode } = useColorModes();
  // or Even useEffect;
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    applyMode(colorMode);
    // passing zero length dependencies array makes the effect to happen one time
  }, []);
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <ColorMode />
      <div>Some content</div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## The difference

Here is the difference imported from dev tools profiler and slowed to one frame per second.
Each transition is per click and to a different article.

the **first** one when using `useLayoutEffect` we can see the transition is sharp no
flicker between the color modes. The **second** when using `useEffect` the transition
caused a flicker you will notice switching between articles is not sharp like in the first.

**Try to focus on each gif and compare results later, don't focus on both of them at one time.**

<Collage
  photos={useEffectResults}
  totalPages={0}
  initialLength={8}
  disallowScrollLoad={true}
/>

Fortunately, You can try this experiment on production now after you read this article. I am using `useLayoutEffect`
to cycle through the color modes. Just navigate between the website content and you will see!
